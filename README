# BubbleUPnP Server 0.7.0 for Arch Linux
BubbleUPnP Server is a small Java application designed to provide secure
Internet access to your existing UPnP/DLNA content. It works with
BubbleUPnP for Android as well as foobar2000.

This set of files is packaged for the Arch User Repository, allowing
Arch Linux users to easily install BubbleUPnP Server. It is based on the
vendor's Ubuntu package and modified to work with systemd rather than
Upstart.

### AUR

Arch User Repository at:
